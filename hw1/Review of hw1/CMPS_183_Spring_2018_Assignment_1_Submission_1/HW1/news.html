                            A new study finds polar bears in the wild have higher metabolic rates than previously thought, and as climate change alters
                            their environment a growing number of bears are unable to catch enough prey to meet their energy
                            needs. </p>
                        <p>
                            The study, published February 2 in Science, reveals the physiological mechanisms behind observed declines in polar bear populations,
                            said first author Anthony Pagano, a Ph.D. candidate at UC Santa Cruz. "We've been documenting
                            declines in polar bear survival rates, body condition, and population numbers over the past decade,"
                            he said. "This study identifies the mechanisms that are driving those declines by looking at
                            the actual energy needs of polar bears and how often they're able to catch seals."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Pagano, who is also a wildlife biologist with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), conducted the study as part of his Ph.D.
                            thesis research at UC Santa Cruz, where he has been working with coauthors Terrie Williams and
                            Daniel Costa, both professors of ecology and evolutionary biology.

                            The researchers monitored the behavior, hunting success, and metabolic rates of adult female polar bears without cubs as
                            they hunted for prey on the sea ice of the Beaufort Sea in the spring. High-tech collars on the
                            bears recorded video, locations, and activity levels over a period of eight to 11 days, while
                            metabolic tracers enabled the team to determine how much energy the bears expended.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The field metabolic rates they measured averaged more than 50 percent higher than previous studies had predicted. Five of
                            the nine bears in the study lost body mass, meaning they weren't catching enough fat-rich marine
                            mammal prey to meet their energy demands.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            "This was at the start of the period from April through July when polar bears catch most of their prey and put on most of
                            the body fat they need to sustain them throughout the year," Pagano said.

                    collaboration and networking. The 36-hour coding marathon is also an opportunity for Silicon Valley companies
                    to meet the next generation of innovators. Sponsors including Google's virtual reality product, Daydream,
                    and UC Santa Cruz's Genomics Institute challenged the 88 teams to produce apps employing a range of technologies.
